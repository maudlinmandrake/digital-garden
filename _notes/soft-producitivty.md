title: What is soft productivity?
---
- _It is_
  - Accepting limitations; not fighting them, but working with them. This means that your definitions of "busy" or what constitutes a productive day will vary wildly. Remember that comparison is the thief of joy.
  - Accepting failure and mistakes as an integral part of the process. Self-compassion, in all things.
  - Rest and self-care is necessary to productivity and should be penciled in the way you would anything else. As trite as the saying is, you cannot run on an empty gas tank.
  - It accepts gentle work as an acceptable mode of productivity; see more here: [[Showing up every day, softly]]
