# About Me

## The usual boring details: I live in <span style="color: #7A7A7A">🏁 Indianapolis</span> with my husband, our daughter, and approximately <span style="color: #6DBA82"> 🌵 30 houseplants</span> (I'm slowly running out of space for my family). Despite being almost 35 years old, I'm still trying to figure out who exactly I am.

As it turns out, you are not handed a card at the age of 30 declaring you an Offical Adult along with AI-generated guidelines to fulfill your assigned role. I can tell you that I've always adored computers, ever since I was a wee one of 8, wasting computer paper making books on my dad's Amiga Commodore 64. We acquired our first Windows machine when I was an older pre-teen/young teen, and my book-making skills translated into several Internet ventures: a newsletter that I sent out via AOL Zine World, a multitude of personal pages graciously hosted by friends filled with maudlin poetry and artwork, a highly customized Neopets website, and of course my well-maintained LiveJournal that was constantly tweaked.
