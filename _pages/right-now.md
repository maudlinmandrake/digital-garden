# What I'm up to right now

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
1. I'm a little over halfway through my **_#100DaysofCode_** challenge; I've put about 90 hours in since I started!
2. I'm learning __React.js__.
3. I'm in my last semester of school. In the spring of 2021 I'll be graduating with an Associates in Human Services & Social Work...a field that, unfortunately, I've realized I don't really want to work in (I found out that I'm not really cut out for the work after going through crisis counselor training).
