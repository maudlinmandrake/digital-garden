# <span class="big"><em>Jenny Mikac</em></span>

## is an 🎨 <span style="color: grey">artist</span> who ✍️ <span style="color: grey">writes</span>.

You can read **more** [about me](./about){: .internal-link} or go to [Right Now](/right-now){: .internal-link} to see what I'm currently up to. If you'd like to see my art, you can find it all on my [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/ykantjennypaint.jpg). I have art available at my [print shop](https://jrm.threadless.com/) if you're looking to spruce up your bedroom walls. I'm an unsatiable maw when it comes to reading, you can [check out my list](https://beta.readng.co/user/jennymikac) to see what I'm currently reading and have read in the past.

This is not a typical blog. It's a digital garden. There's no hierarchy. There's no linear order. You explore it through links; a little like getting lost in the woods. You can start here, with something I wrote about [[Showing up every day, softly]]. None of the writing is set in stone; things are loose and wiggly around here. Page dates will reflect when I last updated my thoughts. Good luck out there 🔍

If you love my work, ☕️ [please consider buying me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/ykantjennypaint) as a small thanks.
